# To enable ProGuard in your project, edit project.properties
# to define the proguard.config property as described in that file.
#
# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in ${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt
# You can edit the include path and order by changing the ProGuard
# include property in project.properties.
#
# For more details, see
#   http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# MediaPhone specific (not in proguard-project.txt as it is deleted if we disable proguard temporarily):

-dontobfuscate # we want useful stack traces, and we're open-source anyway (obfuscating only saves around 80KB)

# duplicated from proguard-android-optimize.txt to fix a proguard bug
# (when not optimizing but not obfuscating - see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7587680)
# -optimizations !code/allocation/variable,!code/simplification/cast,!field/*,!class/merging/*

# so proguard doesn't remove the BluetoothObserver class (used via reflection)
-keep public class * extends android.os.FileObserver {
    public protected *;
}
